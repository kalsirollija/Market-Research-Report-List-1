<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Air Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement</li><li>Dynamic Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stationary air compressor market is primarily divided into two types: positive displacement and dynamic displacement compressors. Positive displacement compressors work by trapping a fixed amount of air and compressing it to a higher pressure, typically using mechanisms like pistons or rotary screws. In contrast, dynamic displacement compressors rely on high-speed rotating components to impart velocity to the air, converting it into pressure through diffusion. Each type serves distinct industrial applications based on efficiency, air quality, and pressure requirements.</p></p>
