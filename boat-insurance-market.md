<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boat Insurance Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Actual Cash Value</li><li>Agreed Amount Value</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boat insurance typically operates within two primary market types: Actual Cash Value (ACV) and Agreed Amount Value. ACV policies compensate for the boat's current market value minus depreciation at the time of a loss, ensuring the owner receives a fair, albeit possibly lower, payout.
